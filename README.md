## About the Video Course
GraphQL, an API query-language from Facebook, is designed to illustrate the 

complex, nested data dependencies of modern web applications. It is quickly 

becoming the standard for API development and is touted as a game-changer in 

years to come. React is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks used to 

build scalable frontend applications.

This course is a hands-on guide that will help you build strong full-stack 

applications using React and Apollo GraphQL platform. The course starts with 

Hello World in GraphQL and in a step-by-step manner progressively introduces 

advanced topics covered with theoretical and practical examples.
You'll cover challenges and problems and fix them via GraphQL's unique 

features. By the end of the course, you’ll be able to make architectural and 

design decisions for your application’s API.

By the end of the course, you will be proficient in using GraphQL and React to 

all your full-stack development requirements.
